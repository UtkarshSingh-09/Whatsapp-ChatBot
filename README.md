Automated Text Interaction with OpenAI using Python
This Python script automates text-based interaction by performing a sequence of actions including copying text from a webpage, processing it through OpenAI's GPT model, and pasting the response back into a specific location on the screen. The script uses a combination of libraries to control the mouse and keyboard, interact with the clipboard, and communicate with the OpenAI API.

Features
Automated Mouse and Keyboard Control: The script mimics human behavior by clicking, typing, and dragging the mouse to select text.
Clipboard Interaction: The script copies the selected text from the screen and processes it.
OpenAI Integration: It sends the copied content to OpenAI's GPT model for processing and receives the response.
Automated Pasting: The response from OpenAI is pasted back to a predefined location on the screen.
Platform Support: Works on macOS (with Command key support).
Libraries and Tools Used
pynput: For controlling the mouse and keyboard.
pyperclip: For interacting with the system clipboard.
openai: For interacting with the OpenAI GPT model.
time: For adding necessary delays between actions.
Installation
To run this script, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You also need to install the required libraries.

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code

git clone 
https://github.com/your-username/automated-text-interaction.git

cd automated-text-interaction
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install pynput pyperclip openai
Get OpenAI API Key:

Visit OpenAI's API Documentation to sign up and get an API key.
Replace the api_key in the script with your own OpenAI API key.
How it Works
1. Mouse and Keyboard Control
The script uses pynput.mouse to move the mouse and click at specified screen positions.
pynput.keyboard is used to type text and simulate key presses such as Command + C (for copying) and Command + V (for pasting).
2. Text Selection and Copying
The script automates the process of selecting text on a webpage (Safari, for example) and copying it to the clipboard using macOS shortcuts (Command + C).
3. OpenAI API Interaction
The copied content is sent to OpenAI's GPT model, specifically the gpt-4o-mini model, for processing.
A predefined system prompt is used to instruct the model on how to respond to the copied content.
4. Automated Pasting
The response generated by OpenAI is copied back to the clipboard.
The script then pastes the response back into a designated location on the screen.
5. Repeatable Process
The script runs in an infinite loop, continuously performing the steps above for any new copied content that matches certain criteria.
Usage
Edit the Sender Name:

In the is_message_from_sender function, replace "write the sender name correctly" with the name of the sender you want to match.
Run the Script:

Simply run the script by executing:
bash
Copy code
python automate_interaction.py
Observe the Actions:

The script will simulate human actions on your computer, such as clicking, typing, and pasting content.
You can modify the screen positions (e.g., mouse.position = (1208, 4)) to match your specific screen resolution and workflow.
Important Notes
API Key: Be sure to keep your OpenAI API key secure. Avoid hardcoding it directly in the script. Use environment variables or a config file for better security practices.
Screen Resolution: The mouse positions and actions are based on fixed coordinates. You may need to adjust these based on your screen resolution and the application you are interacting with.
Permissions: On macOS, you might need to grant accessibility permissions for Python to control the mouse and keyboard.

Example Output
When the script is running, it will print the following information to the terminal:

Copied content: Shows the content that has been copied to the clipboard.
Response from OpenAI: The response generated by the GPT model.
Data pasted: Confirms that the response has been pasted back to the screen.
